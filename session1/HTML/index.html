            <img src="./images/background.png" alt=""Background Image />
            <p>Jessica's Cocktail Lounge was founded by Jess Rose, an aspiring Full Stack developer passionate about coding. This fine establishment was created as part of the series of Coding&Cocktails, a Meetup group focused on Women in Tech interested in Coding. Jessica's Cocktail Lounge is Jess Rose's first attempt at a website. The goal of this website is to provide the world with some tasty cocktail recipes that anyone can make at home, without having to scroll through an entire book of text just to get to the "free" recipe ;). We hope that you find Jessica's Cocktail Lounge full of exciting new recipes to try at home, with your friends, or even at a party you host! Feel free to email us at jessrose.codes@gmail.com if you would like your recipe to be included on our website!
